<br><b>Features:</b>

* iOS and Android application
* fast and easy receipt parser using OCR
* store receipts permanently in a SQL database
* minimal design
* no third party apps

Parsing receipts is not only time consuming, it is moreover a very powerful task. Since mobile devices have a unacceptable performance, the parser uses a (traditional) client server architecture.

<br><b>How it works:</b>

* The User makes a photo of a receipt
* The Application uploads the receipt to the sever
* The Server parses the receipt and sends the output (as JSON response) back to the application
* The Application stores the receipt in a SQL database

<br><b>Privacy:</b>

A lot of companies store and sell your data. This is the main reason why I started this project. I want to control my private data. Since <b>you are hosting <a href='https://github.com/ReceiptManager/Server' target='_blank'>your own server</a>,</b> you donâ€™t have to worry about that. No third party services are used.
