## Architecture
Parsing receipts is not only time consuming, it is moreover a very powerful task. 
Since mobile devices have a unacceptable performance, the parser uses a (traditional) client server architecture.

#### How it works
1. The User makes a photo of a receipt
2. The Application upload the receipt to the sever
3. The Sever parses the receipt and send the output (as json response) back to the application
4. The Application store the receipt in a SQL database

### Privacy
A lot of companies store and sell your data. This is the main reason why I started this project. 
I want to control my private data. Since you are hosting your own server, your don't have to
worry about that. No third party services are used.
